              In this immersive learning experience, I delved deep into key aspects of full-stack development, covering both technical skills and collaborative project management. Throughout the week, I learned how to articulate technical features implemented in my projects, executed Git branching workflows in collaborative environments, resolved merge conflicts, and gained insights into agile software development methodologies. The highlight of the week was the creation of an Interactive Front-End Application as part of a collaborative group project. This hands-on endeavor challenged me to design, build, and deploy a real-world solution, integrating data from server-side APIs and demonstrating proficiency in agile methodologies. I also honed my skills in creating professional presentations and comprehensive README files, essential for showcasing my work to potential employers. I embraced the collaborative spirit, worked with my team to overcome challenges, and presented our innovative project that reflected my growing expertise in full-stack development.</p>
